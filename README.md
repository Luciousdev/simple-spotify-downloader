# Simple spotify song/playlist downloader

This is a simple program coded in [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and it uses FFMPEG and spotdl for downloading. It's not really a "program" since it just calls an api, it's just for ease of use.

## Installation

Downloaded the repo and extract is somewhere (e.g. on a folder on your desktop.)

also make sure to install [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing python type this command in cmd/terminal to install spotdl.

```bash
pip install spotdl
```

don't forget to also install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/), you can use [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1AtmY-RMyQ) tutorial made by TroubleChute for a guide on how to install FFMPEG.

## Usage

Open a terminal in the folder where you have installed the main.py python file, after type the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

that will give the following output:

```bash
URL: 
```

Then just type in the URL of the playlist or song that you want to download and it should do all the work for you. The songs will be downloaded in the folder where you've installed the main.py . (the songs will be downloaded in mp3 format.)

## Trouble?

If you have any trouble you can add me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/524229083014365194) (or Lucy_Sweets#0001 for if the link doesn't work). I'll try to answer asap, if there is a major error (which I don't expect) I'll most likely not update the program since it was just a simple thing that I made in a couple minutes.

## License

There's no license do with it whatever you want idc.
